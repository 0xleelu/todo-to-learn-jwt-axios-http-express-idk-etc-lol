this is (most probably) an ugliest todo application obv. to learn some concepts as a part of my cohort learning.

i dont think theres any need to run this lol, but if you want to run this follow this:
- run the frontend seprately by using **go live extension** or **npx serve** in *public/*
- and in the **root/parent directory** run `node app.js`

the above instructions will let you run the todo application. happy todo-ing! :)
